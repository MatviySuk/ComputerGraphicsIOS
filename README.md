This application is developing during the course of Computer Graphics in LPNU. 

Fractals:
Now fractals are available in the app. You could try to generate Brownian Motion or Plasma(Square-Diamond algorithm) fractals. Moreover, settings are available, so you can change them and generate many versions of fractals.
